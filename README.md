# NullPointerException in Dart with Nullable Variables

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart: encountering a `NullPointerException` when working with nullable variables.  The code example shows how a nullable variable is declared using `?`, but a null check is missing before attempting to access a method, resulting in a runtime error.

The `bug.dart` file contains the code with the error. The `bugSolution.dart` file provides a corrected version that addresses the issue using null checks.  This is crucial for robust Dart development.
